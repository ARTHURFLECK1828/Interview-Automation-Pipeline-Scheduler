# SCHEDULER - MIC Interview Automation
The overall project is to automate the interviewing procedure of candidates applying to join Microsoft Innovations Club.

## SCHEDULER
This repo works on the scheduling part only.
Given the details of the candidates who are to be interviewed, this project (this repo) will create an interview schedule (timeline) and provide it to the interviewers and to the fresh candidates as well.

This is just the basic idea, working on more features and plans

## Points to Consider

1. Basic Scheduler
2. Pre/Postpone 1 interview from the edge
3. Pre/Postpone 1 interview from the middle creating a void
4. Pre/Postpone all the interviews
5. Handling of Leap year, February, months with 30 or 31 days
6. Verifying if start date & time is not already behind current date & time 
7. Add single/multiple new entries after all interviews are scheduled
Note: try creating a diff dict storing interviews' info with keys as date
Note: Try making it as modular as possible
