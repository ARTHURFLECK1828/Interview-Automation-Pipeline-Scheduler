# SCHEDULER - MIC Interview Automation
The overall project is to automate the interviewing procedure of candidates applying to join Microsoft Innovations Club.

## SCHEDULER
This repo works on the scheduling part only.
Given the details of the candidates who are to be interviewed, this project (this repo) will create an interview schedule (timeline) and provide it to the interviewers and to the fresh candidates as well.
